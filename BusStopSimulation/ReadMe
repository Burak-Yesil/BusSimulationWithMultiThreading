//PEOPLE: A person arrives at the bus stop queue
//People wait in line for the bus, and a new person shows up after a exponentially-distributed inter-arrival) time.

//BUS STOP/ARRIVAL: A bus arrives at a bus stop 
//If the bus stop is empty move to next stop and do this. otherwise, at the next bus stop, the first person in 
//line boards the bus.

//BOARDER: The bus stop line size decrements by one
//Bus decrements until the stop is empty 

//Format of initialization.txt
//line 1: number of bus stops
//line 2: number of buses
